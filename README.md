# ML-PedroDomingos-CSEP-546

This repository contains my notes from [Prof. Pedro Domingos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KOrhfVMAAAAJ&hl=en)' machine learning lecture, which can be found both on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/LnlW9gdjWfc?list=PLTPQEx-31JXgtDaC6-3HxWcp7fq4N8YGr) and on the [website](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep546/16sp/) of **The University of Washington**.  

I should state that I am by no means claiming to be an expert, and all of my notes are subject to change and/or modification. I'm fully aware that some sections of my notes contain inconsistencies, typos, unconventional syntax & etc. In that case, please feel free to open an issue, so we can discuss them later on.

Also, feel free to fork this repo, download the files or even share them anywhere you would like. Hope someone finds these random notes of mine useful.



# Process

I take these notes with [Typora](https://typora.io/), which offers a great set of tools to write ```Markdown```. Some parts of my notes will probably look unfinished, since GitHub doesn't render everything _(e.g. the diagrams, math blocks, Latex & etc.)_. To view the files as intended, you might need to download/open the ```HTML``` format of them. You can find more information on this topic in Typora's [support](https://support.typora.io/Draw-Diagrams-With-Markdown/). 

Additionally, you can check out these websites for the ```JavaScript``` tools used in the backend of Typora:

1.  [**Mermaid**](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
2.  [**Bramp-JS sequence diagrams**](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/)
3.  [**Flowchart.JS**](https://flowchart.js.org/)

It should be noted that, most resources recommend inserting the images of these diagrams, instead of directly writing them down in ```Markdown```. Problems might occur when viewing these files on online platforms, therefore, inserting images is the safest bet. Not to forget, ```Latex``` won't be shown properly as well, so keep that in mind when viewing the notes on GitHub.

Furthermore, if someone wants to view these notes on their mobile, they can enable the _open in desktop view_ option in their mobile browser _(usually in hamburger menu)_, download the ```zip``` file of the project, unzip it and finally view it online by selecting the ```HTML``` file and opening it in a browser _(since opening it via a mobile text editor will show the source code fully)_.  

With all of these being said, I still prefer typing everything in Typora and not care how they look on GitHub. The best way of presenting the notes is definitely exporting them to ```HTML``` and then opening them in a browser.
