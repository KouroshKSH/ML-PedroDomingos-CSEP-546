# ML-PedroDomingos-CSEP-546

This repository contains my notes from [Prof. Pedro Domingos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KOrhfVMAAAAJ&hl=en)' machine learning lectures, which can be found both on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/LnlW9gdjWfc?list=PLTPQEx-31JXgtDaC6-3HxWcp7fq4N8YGr) and **The University of Washington**'s own [website](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep546/16sp/).  



# Process

I take these notes with [Typora](https://typora.io/), which offers a great set of tools to write ```Markdown``` and other stuff as well. Some parts of my notes will probably look unfinished, since GitHub won't render some of them _(e.g. the diagrams, math blocks, Latex & etc.)_. To view the files as intended, you might need to download/open the ```HTML``` format of them. You can find more information on this in ```Typora```'s [support](https://support.typora.io/Draw-Diagrams-With-Markdown/). 

Additionally, you can check out these websites for the ```JS``` tools:

1.  [**Mermaid**](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
2.  [**Bramp-JS sequence diagrams**](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/)
3.  [**Flowchart.JS**](https://flowchart.js.org/)

It should be noted that, most resources recommend inserting the images of these diagrams, instead of directly writing them down in ```Markdown```. Problems might occur when viewing these files on other platforms, therefore, using images is the safest bet.
