I should state that I am by no means claiming to be an expert, and all of my notes are subject to change and/or modification. I'm fully aware that some sections of my notes contain inconsistencies, typos, unconventional syntax & etc. In that case, please feel free to open an issue, so we can discuss them later on.

Also, feel free to fork this repo, download the files or even share them anywhere you would like. Hope someone finds these random notes of mine useful.

# Process
At the time of taking these notes, I was using [Typora](https://typora.io/), which offered a great set of tools to write ```Markdown```. Some parts of my notes will probably look unfinished, since I did not go through the whole course (until lecture 4).

## Other Tools
Additionally, you can check out these websites for the ```JavaScript``` tools used in the backend of Typora:
1.  [**Mermaid**](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
2.  [**Bramp-JS sequence diagrams**](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/)
3.  [**Flowchart.JS**](https://flowchart.js.org/)

It should be noted that, most resources recommend inserting the images of these diagrams, instead of directly writing them down in ```Markdown```. Problems might occur when viewing these files on online platforms, therefore, inserting images is the safest bet.

## Math Formulas
At the time of writing, $\LaTeX$ was not supported by GitHub, however, things have changed since then and you can see the math formula rendered properly.

> For demonstration purposes: 
> - inline mode: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
> - display mode: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
